      <h1>Password Management</h1>
      <p>
        What according to you is a password? Well, I think passwords are a set
        of numbers, alphabets, and special characters that make a combination to
        keep our data protected. Do you think passwords matter in our day-to-day
        life? Of course, it matters because it keeps our personal information
        hidden and inaccessible by any other user. For example, your social
        account, bank, eCommerce account, and more accounts are all protected by
        a combination of passcodes that are accessible by only you. It’s obvious
        that in today’s world, passwords need to be protected.

      <h1>How to keep our password safe</h1>
      <p>
        There are multiple ways we can manage our passwords. Firstly, by making
        a hard copy of passwords, and keeping them safe in a location where
        nobody can see them. Secondly, having a soft copy that cannot be
        accessed by any other person, or creating a single password to save all
        the other passwords. On top of that, are we sure that we manage our
        passwords with precautions? I think we do make some mistakes here and
        there which keeps our passwords vulnerable to other people/hackers. I
        strongly feel that we need to have some precautions when we manage our
        passwords. For example, not using your passwords on any free or local
        wifi. That makes our passwords vulnerable to the user who has access to
        the wifi.

      <h1>Steps to protect our password</h1>
      <p>
        Furthermore, never login into anyone‘s system whom you don’t trust. Here
        are a few recommendations to reduce the chance of your passwords being
        hacked. <br />*By using the password rule method (firstly, not using
        your username. Secondly, not repeating the old passwords. Thirdly, using
        both uppercase and lowercase with some special characters) <br />*Enable
        2FA (Factor authentication). It’s a new method in which both your phone
        number and email id are required. You get a code to log in, which
        protects you from hackers. <br />*Don’t Log in on an insecure website or
        one which you do not trust.
      </p>

      <h1>Prevention of hacking</h1>
      <p>
        Why do I recommend this? Because I have had personal experiences
        throughout my life. I can share a personal life experience where I was
        using a simple password and I did not enable 2FA, as I did not have any
        idea about this security feature. My password got hacked but I did not
        suffer a great loss of information. This made me realize that
        maintaining a strong password is a necessity.<br />
        Don’t you think managing passwords is a very big hassle? We are
        dependent on technology which makes it difficult to remember passwords.
        Even more so, managing passwords keeps the tension on our head whether
        it will get hacked, or we tend to forget the password. So, I strongly
        feel that passwords are very risky and difficult to maintain.
