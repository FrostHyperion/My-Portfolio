        Hello, My name is Sahil Kumar. You can address me by my first name
        Sahil,I was born in Haryana near Delhi.Then moved onto Banglore at the
        age of 8, which is on the south end of India. It's also known as the
        "silicon valley of India" because of its role in promoting the IT sector
        of India. I have done my schooling at BP Indian Public School and high
        school from Hymamshu Jyothi Kala Peetha with a major in computer
        science. My all time favourite sport is basketball. I had taken part in
        many tournaments during my high school year, and I have played at

        One of my favourite hobbies is to travel with my friends and exploring
        new places. So, recently I visited nandi hills which are situated near
        the district of chikballapur. As we reached the top of the hill we just
        experienced a whole new and exquisite world. I just remembered a funny
        incident, while having a small photo session a monkey just appeared out
        of nowhere and snatched my friendâ€™s phone and ran away later we got the
        phone by luring the monkey with some bananas.
