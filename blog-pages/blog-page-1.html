        SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. It helps to keep sensitive
        information secure. When the data is being transferred between two
        systems and thus prevents criminals and hackers from tweaking or
        mishandling the transferred data.Example: When you share your personal
        details, SSL makes sure that your details do not fall in the wrong
        hands.TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. It helps to encrypt
        sensitive and personal information. It is the same as SSL but with more
        security and encryption. Nowadays the number of hackers who steal our
        data is rapidly increasing so TLS fulfills the need for SSL in a more
        enhanced. We can determine by checking the URL if it contains HTTPS.
        This tells us that the data is transferred securely between the server
        and users. Moreover secure means that our data is not being misused by
        hackers or criminals. Encryption means that your data is encoded in such
        a manner that it cannot be recognized by an unknown user who tries to
        access our data, which means that a random user cannot access or decrypt
        the data other than the original user and the server.

        HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and HTTPS stands for
        HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. Both help us to represent our data
        on the screen, but, HTTPS is more secure and reliable by encrypting data
        with the newest technology. We can even say HTTPS is the extension of
        HTTP.Example: There’s a site with no HTTPS URL and it’s a clown of some
        banking or e-commerce websites where you log in with your bank detail,
        personal account information, etc. All of our data gets transferred to
        an unknown user without even realizing it. We assume that we are
        shopping, transferring money and feel it’s very safe without having an
        idea of the negative outcomes. Hence, we should always verify the
        website by HTTPS URL.

        An SSL certificate authority provides a digital certificate to the
        website in return helps us to have a secure connection and keeps our
        data encrypted. According to my, I want all my personal information to
        be secured which cannot be misused by another person or a user. For
        example, personal information is like getting to know your bank account
        details, e-commerce account details, or any other account login
        credentials and personal life information, like where I go, the number
        of family members, a place where I leave, my occupation, etc. are
        valuable information to me.
