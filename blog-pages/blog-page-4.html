      <h1>HOW TO PLAY BLUFF</h1>
      <p>
        Firstly, the cards need to be well shuffled and then dividend into equal
        number with each other. Any player can decide who wants to start first
        till last and can be arranged in any order to start the game. The first
        player by placing a 1 or more card facing-down on the center of the
        table while declaring the rank of card. On top of that it can be either
        true or a lie about the card placed. Then next player has three options
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Pass your chance</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Play your chance</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Call bluff</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Pass your chance</h3>
      <p>
        In this player may choose not to play a card. If your chance is passed
        then you cannot play until the 1 round completes and can continue at 2nd
        time the round starts with the same set of cards. Once everybody says
        pass then the set of cards placed on the center of the table are kept
        aside. With that we need to start the next round whoever placed the last
        card gets to start first in the next round.
      </p>
      <h3>play your chance</h3>
      <p>
        If the first player places the cards, then second player can place his
        card even if the same card is available or not by the second player but
        player can still place a card by telling a lie.
      </p>
      <h3>Call by bluff</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose first player places his card then the second player believes he
        is telling a lie or the third player believes second player is telling a
        lie and so on. Then the second or any other player can call bluff in
        which they check whether the card is same as the player mentioned before
        placing. If the card rank is same as the player mentioned then which
        player called the Bluff has to pick all the cards placed on the table
        otherwise it's not the same then the player who placed wrong card has to
        pick all the cards. Whoever finishes their cards first is the winner and
        then continued by the other player until their card are over.

      <h1>Strategy To Win the game</h1>
      <p>
        There are multiple strategies that we can use for wining few of the
        games .Here i would like to discuss two of my favourite strategies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">
          Don’t keep on lying which makes you an easy target be more
          unpredictable so you do not get caught when anybody calls for bluff.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check when the player puts any rank card and you have 2 or 3 of those
          card then the player is mostly lying about the card. Example the
          player puts 2 kings and you have 3 kings it becomes obvious that he is
          lying and call out bluff.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <table class="bluff_table">
