      <h1>HTML AND CSS</h1>
      <p>
        HTML or “HyperText Markup Language”. It’s a programming language that
        helps us to display the text, images, and links on the web browser.
        Apart from that, you may be wondering why we need CSS or “Cascading
        Style Sheets”. CSS helps users to add styles to make the website look
        more responsive. For Example: suppose you are making a car from scratch.
        Firstly, you build the body of the car without paint, wheels, and
        function. This is like Html. Secondly, we customize the car by painting
        the car, installing wheels, mirrors, etc. That is the CSS part.

      <h1> Elaborating into HTML
      </h1>
      <p>Let’s dive deeper into Html. First and foremost is Html tags. Tags are the basic building characters for a website. Tags are represented by this symbol “<>”. There are around 100 tags. Here are a few examples like (<html,body,title) and many more. Moving on with Html elements. Elements are the content inside the Html tag with an opening and closing tag. Example:  <p>lorem ipsum</p>.
        Furthermore, What are Html Attributes? Attributes are the special words used to control an element inside a tag. It’s also a modifier of an Html element (id, class, title, style). Last but not Least, Inline elements and Block elements. Inline elements only take however much width is required and leaves space for the other elements in the same line. On the other hand, Block elements take the entire line width, not allowing another element to stay in the same line. Hence moving it into the next line

         <h1>  More about  CSS  </h1>
         <p>Now, Html basics are done. Moving into CSS or Cascading Style Sheets. There are some CSS rules before defining CSS. First, we have a CSS selector which connects to the elements of HTML to assign certain CSS properties to the selected HTML elements. A CSS rule is called when one or more selectors are applied to one or more selected Html elements. CSS values are the property inside the CSS declaration block. Example: blue, percentage, length, width, etc.</p>
